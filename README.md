## Transforming Natural Language into Hospital Database Queries

### Overview

Welcome to *MediQuery AI*, a project dedicated to bridging the gap between natural human language and complex SQL queries for hospital databases. This repository explores the power of Large Language Model (LLM) prompt engineering to convert everyday English text into executable SQL, making data retrieval from healthcare databases more intuitive and accessible.

### The Challenge

Hospital databases are rich with critical patient information, treatment details, and administrative data. However, querying these databases often requires specialized SQL knowledge, posing a significant barrier for healthcare professionals and researchers who need quick insights.

### Our Solution

MediQuery AI leverages advanced LLM prompt engineering techniques to intelligently parse natural language requests and translate them into accurate SQL queries. Imagine asking, "Show me all patients admitted last week with pneumonia," and instantly getting the corresponding SQL query to run against your hospital's database. This project aims to empower users to interact with healthcare data using the language they already know.

### Key Features (Planned/In Progress)

* Natural Language to SQL Conversion: Core functionality for transforming English text into SQL.
* Database Schema Awareness: Strategies for the LLM to understand and utilize the specific schema of a hospital database (e.g., table names, column names, relationships).
* Error Handling & Validation: Mechanisms to identify and address potential ambiguities or errors in generated queries.
* Prompt Engineering Best Practices: Demonstrations and examples of effective prompt design for optimal LLM performance in this domain.
* Extensibility: Designed to be adaptable to various hospital database structures and SQL dialects.

### Getting Started (Future)

Detailed instructions on setting up the environment, configuring LLM access, and running examples will be provided here as the project progresses.

### Use Cases

* Clinical Research: Quickly extract patient cohorts based on specific criteria.
* Hospital Administration: Generate reports on bed occupancy, resource utilization, and operational metrics.
* Medical Billing: Query billing data with ease for auditing and analysis.
* Data Exploration: Empower non-technical users to explore the database without needing SQL expertise.
